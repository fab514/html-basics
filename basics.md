# Basics
## Lorem text
- Lorem is sample text that can be put in an HTML file. You can adjust the amount of text that you would like put in by using lorem10(or any number).
## Inline vs Block Level Elements
- Inline Elements do not have to start on a new line and only take the necessary width. 
- Block Elements start a new line and take the full width available. 

- Block Level tags include <div>, <h1>-<h6>, <p>, <form>
- Inline Level tags include <span>, <img>, <a>
## Div Tag
- A div tag is a container for block level elements. It shows the divisions between each block and is used by CSS and JS to manipulate a block element. 

## span tag
- a span tag is an inline container used to markup part of a text or document. It is similar to a div tag however it is an inline element instead of a block level element. 
- A span tag can be easily manipulated by CSS and JavaScript.
## Strong 
- A strong tag is used in HTML to bold any words within the opening and closing tags. However it is better to use CSS to change text. 
## Emphasized tag <em>
- An <em> tag is used to emphasise or italisize text that is within the opening and closing tags. Again best to use CSS. 
## Links <a>
- An <a> tag is for a links. Links can either be used locally, for example linking another file page to the homepage or sending the user to an external page. 
- <a href=""> href is an attribute to the link tag. If you want the user to open the link to another window you can add an target attribute. Best if you want the user to reman on your website however not best to use if you are navigating to other pages of your website.
